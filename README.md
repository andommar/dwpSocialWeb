# dwpSocialWeb

## Project Structure

- Index (home) imports 3 views: header, leftmenu, userfeed and rightmenu

## Pending Tasks

- In the process of implementing Bootstrap 5.1
- Basic CRUD > Update and delete
- User login > A user should login with username or email
- Sign up
- User settings
- Post creation
- Post comment and comments in general
- Voting
- Validations and errors

## Issues

- SignUp and other forms: page reloads after validation errors (when submitting) and the user must rewrite everything!
- When signing up correctly, it redirects user to login, so the message of successful registration has no time to be shown
- Check Image types when loading posts images, avatar, etc
- Main page side menus overlap when resizing browser
